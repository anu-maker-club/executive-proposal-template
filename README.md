# ANU Maker Club Executive Proposal Template

## Introduction

Despite the name, this template can and should be used for almost all extended (i.e. more than one page) ANUMC documents, 
particularly plans, proposals, reports, and non-software documentation.

Feel free to modify as needed; the key part of the template is the logo and cover page.
